#Git instructions

First in order to initialize your git repo with the existing data, do:
    mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME
    cd DIRECTORY_NAME
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/gilgameshskytrooper/reverselist.git
    git pull origin master

Then from this point you can do the standard add, commit, pull, push commands.
